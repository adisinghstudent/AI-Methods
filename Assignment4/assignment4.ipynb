Since both shape and wrapper depend on flavor, the arrows should originate from flavor and point toward both shape and wrapper.

The question seems to imply that both networks (i) and (iii) could be correct in part 1.1, but because the scenario states that shape and wrapper are determined by flavor, flavor must act as the parent node.
